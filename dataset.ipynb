I showed it to some friends of mine in my movie club, and they were kept spellbound until the ending! No blood or gore- just good old fashioned suspense. It starts out right from the beginning, and builds and builds. The ending is a real twist that caught me unawares. \n",

      "Source: You are an AI assistant that helps people find information. User will you give you a question. Your task is to answer as faithfully as you can. While answering think step-bystep and justify your answer. Question. Context: Heliocentrism is the astronomical model in which the Earth and planets revolve around the Sun at the center of the Solar System. Historically, Heliocentrism was opposed to geocentrism, which placed the Earth at the center. The notion that the Earth revolves around the Sun had been proposed as early as the 3rd century BCE by Aristarchus of Samos, but at least in the medieval world, Aristarchus's Heliocentrism attracted little attention -- possibly because of the loss of scientific works of the Hellenistic Era.\n",

      "Answer. Aristarchus of Samos\n",

      "Response: Step 1: Identify the context and timeframe of the question.\n",
      "The context of the question revolves around the concept of heliocentrism, which is the proposal that the Sun is the center of the solar system. The timeframe mentioned is as early as the 3rd century BCE, which is when the concept was initially proposed.\n",

      "Step 2: Understand the opposing views in the context.\n",

      "Step 3: Identify key figures related to the heliocentric model.\n",
      "The question asks for the individual who initially proposed the Sun as the center of the solar system. Aristarchus of Samos is mentioned as the person who proposed this model as early as the 3rd century BCE.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 4: Verify the credibility of the claim.\n",
      "The text mentions that Aristarchus's heliocentrism attracted little attention at the time possibly due to the loss of scientific works of the Hellenistic Era, implying that his proposal was indeed an early instance of heliocentrism.\n",
